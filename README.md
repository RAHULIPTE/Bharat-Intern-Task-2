# Bharat-Intern-Task-2

I want to create a system that predicts a person's likelihood of survival in a sinking situation. The key factors that are likely to influence their chances of survival include socio-economic status, age, and gender. The system will analyze these factors to make predictions about a person's safety in such a scenario.
